1. Bible Version: KJV → Default marked → First available
2. Book: Genesis → Order 1 → First available  
3. Chapter: 1 (always)
4. Verse: 1 (always)
```

**Reference Parsing Patterns:**
```typescript
// Supported formats:
- "John 3:16" → Book: John, Chapter: 3, Verse: 16
- "Genesis 1" → Book: Genesis, Chapter: 1, Verse: 1 (default)
- "Romans" → Book: Romans, Chapter: 1, Verse: 1 (defaults)
- "1 John 2:5" → Book: 1 John, Chapter: 2, Verse: 5
```

**Book Name Matching:**
```typescript
// Matching strategy:
1. Exact match (case insensitive)
2. Short name match
3. Partial/contains match  
4. Starts with match
```
