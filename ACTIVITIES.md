  - Created `initializeBibleDefaults` thunk for automatic KJV + Genesis 1:1 loading
  - Added `navigateToReference` thunk for smart scripture reference parsing
  - Enhanced default selection logic to prefer KJV and Genesis as defaults

- **New Utility Functions**:
  - `parseScriptureReference()` - Parses "John 3:16", "Genesis 1", or book names
  - `findBookByName()` - Fuzzy matching for book names (exact, partial, starts with)
  - Smart chapter/verse validation and fallbacks

- **New Actions**:
  - `setSelectedVerse` - Track specific verse selection
  - `setCurrentReference` - Manage current reference input string
  - `updateCurrentReferenceFromState` - Sync reference display with state

##### 2. Completely Redesigned QuickScriptureSearch Component ✅
- **Tabbed Interface**: 
  - **Navigate Tab**: Smart scripture reference input (e.g., "John 3:16", "Genesis 1")
  - **Search Tab**: Keyword-based search functionality
  
- **Smart Navigation Features**:
  - Real-time reference parsing and validation
  - Auto-complete and error handling for invalid references

  - Recent verses tracking across both tabs
  
- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Auto-focus appropriate input fields when switching tabs
  - Loading states and error messaging
  - Contextual help tips for both navigation and search modes

##### 3. Enhanced ScriptureList Component with Defaults ✅

- **Enhanced Tab System**: Quick Search and Browse tabs work seamlessly
- **Shared State**: Both components share the same Bible state and version selection
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained resizable panel functionality

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Default Selection Logic:**
```typescript
// Priority order for defaults:
1. Bible Version: KJV → Default marked → First available
2. Book: Genesis → Order 1 → First available  
3. Chapter: 1 (always)
4. Verse: 1 (always)
```

**Reference Parsing Patterns:**
```typescript
// Supported formats:
- "John 3:16" → Book: John, Chapter: 3, Verse: 16
- "Genesis 1" → Book: Genesis, Chapter: 1, Verse: 1 (default)
- "Romans" → Book: Romans, Chapter: 1, Verse: 1 (defaults)
- "1 John 2:5" → Book: 1 John, Chapter: 2, Verse: 5
```

**Book Name Matching:**
```typescript
// Matching strategy:
1. Exact match (case insensitive)
2. Short name match
3. Partial/contains match  
4. Starts with match
```
