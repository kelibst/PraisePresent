- Implemented theme toggle (sun/moon icons) at the bottom of the aside, with persistent dark/light mode using CSS variables and Tailwind
- Fixed dark mode bug: now works with Tailwind and custom CSS variables using `:root.dark`
- Removed modal drawer and overlay for navigation; improved accessibility and responsiveness
- Integrated Redux Toolkit for global state management of services
- Updated routing/layout to use a layout component for all pages except homepage
- Improved code structure for maintainability and scalability
