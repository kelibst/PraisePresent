- **Evaluated Prisma vs Current SQLite Implementation**: After analysis, decided to keep the current better-sqlite3 + repository pattern setup. Current implementation is well-suited for read-only Bible data, works excellently with Electron, and provides all needed functionality without added complexity. Prisma would be reconsidered when adding user accounts, dynamic data, or complex relational features.

## May 20, 2024 - Bible Database Integration

### Database Scripts
- Created `analyze-json.js` to determine JSON Bible data structure
- Created `seed-database.js` to convert JSON files to SQLite databases
- Created `verify-database.js` to confirm SQLite database integrity

### Application Integration
- Fixed TypeScript errors in `forge.config.ts` related to electron rebuild configuration
- Added native module handling in `vite.main.config.ts` to properly handle `better-sqlite3`
- Updated `src/main/database.ts` with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Ensured the `scriptureService.ts` provides fallback mock data when database access fails

### Core Challenges Addressed
1. Native module loading for `better-sqlite3` in Electron context
2. Database path resolution for accessing SQLite files
3. Graceful degradation when database access fails
4. Proper IPC communication between main and renderer processes

### Next Steps
- Implement a more robust database connection system
- Improve the error reporting system for failed database operations
- Add additional Bible translations as needed
